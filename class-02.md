# jQuery 
*jQuery is a JavaScript library.

*jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.

*jQuery is easy to learn.

jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.
It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a
quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

The ` html () `and ` text ()` methods both retrieve and update the content
of elements. This page will focus on how to retrieve element content. To
learn how to update element content.
 
`html ()`

When this method is used to retrieve information
from a jQuery selection, it retrieves only the HTML
inside the first element in the matched set, along
with any of its descendants. 

`text ()`

When this method is used to retrieve the text from
a jQuery selection, it returns the content from every
element in the jQuery selection, along with the text
from any descendants. 

`replaceWith() `

This method replaces every
element in a matched set with
new content. It also returns the
replaced elements. 

`remove() `

This method removes all of the
elements in the matched set. 


Inserting new elements involves two steps:
1- Create the new elements in a jQuery object
2- Use a method to insert the content into the page 


**You can create attributes, or access and update
their contents, using the following four methods**
* attr() 

* removeAttr() 

* addCl ass() 

* removeClass() 

The ***. css ()*** method lets you retrieve
and set the values of CSS properties. 


jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality
of a loop on a selection of elements, using the
` each ()` method. 

#### WHERE TO PLACE YOUR
SCRIPTS
